REST DW was created to facilitate the creation of CRUDs in the same model that we created applications for Client / Server Database.
Today to be able to write data in a Bank via WebService is very complex for simple operations, making scheduling of simple screens time-consuming.
With REST DW, you no longer have to worry about creating SQL Insertion, Deletion, Read and Execution methods via Webservice; Simply add a RESTDataBase connection component and add a RESTClientSQL component that will already have your SQL solution fully functional as it did back in the day and with all the power of modern REST / JSON technology with data compression and everything the language can offer,
Use it, have fun, and need support.
